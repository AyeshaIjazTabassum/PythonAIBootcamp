            "Hello! I’m here to help. While the common cold is caused by a virus (meaning antibiotics won't help), there are several effective ways to manage your symptoms and help your body recover faster at home.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are my recommendations for managing a cold:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Hydration is Key\n",
            "Staying hydrated helps thin mucus, making it easier to clear from your lungs and sinuses.\n",
            "*   **Water and Broth:** Sip on water, clear broths, or warm lemon water throughout the day.\n",
            "*   **Warm Liquids:** Herbal teas or warm apple juice can be very soothing for a sore throat and may help loosen congestion.\n",
            "*   **Avoid:** Excessive caffeine or alcohol, as these can lead to dehydration.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Prioritize Rest\n",
            "Your immune system needs energy to fight the virus. \n",
            "*   **Sleep:** Aim for extra sleep.\n",
            "*   **Take it easy:** Avoid strenuous exercise or high-stress activities until you feel better.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Soothe a Sore Throat\n",
            "*   **Saltwater Gargle:** Mix 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of salt in an 8-ounce glass of warm water. Gargle and spit it out. This reduces swelling and loosens mucus.\n",
            "*   **Honey:** A spoonful of honey (or mixed into tea) is a natural cough suppressant and coats the throat. \n",
            "    *   *Note: Never give honey to children under 1 year old due to the risk of botulism.*\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Manage Congestion\n",
            "*   **Saline Sprays/Drops:** Over-the-counter saline (saltwater) drops or sprays can help clear a stuffy nose without the side effects of medicated sprays.\n",
            "*   **Humidity:** Use a cool-mist humidifier in your room or take a steamy shower. Moist air helps keep nasal passages from drying out.\n",
            "*   **Elevation:** Prop your head up with an extra pillow at night to help your sinuses drain.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. Over-the-Counter (OTC) Support\n",
            "While these don't \"cure\" the cold, they help you feel human again:\n",
            "*   **Pain & Fever:** Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil/Motrin) can help with body aches and fever. \n",
            "    *   *Caution: Do not give Aspirin to children or teenagers due to the risk of Reye’s syndrome.*\n",
            "*   **Decongestants/Antihistamines:** These can help with a runny or stuffy nose, but be mindful that some can cause drowsiness or jitters.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. Supplements\n",
            "*   **Vitamin C and Zinc:** Some studies suggest that taking Vitamin C or Zinc lozenges shortly after symptoms start may slightly shorten the duration of a cold.\n",
            "*   **Chicken Soup:** It’s not just an old wives' tale! Chicken soup provides hydration, and the warm vapors help clear nasal passages. Some studies also suggest it has mild anti-inflammatory effects.\n",

            "---\n",
            "\n",

            "Most colds clear up in 7 to 10 days. However, you should seek professional medical attention if you experience:\n",
            "*   **High fever:** A fever over 103°F (39.4°C) or a fever that lasts more than 3 days.\n",
            "*   **Difficulty breathing:** Shortness of breath, wheezing, or chest pain.\n",
            "*   **Worsening symptoms:** If you start feeling better and then suddenly get much worse (this could indicate a secondary bacterial infection like sinusitus or pneumonia).\n",
            "*   **Severe throat pain:** If it hurts significantly to swallow or you see white patches on your tonsils.\n",
            "*   **Duration:** Symptoms that last longer than 10–14 days.\n",
