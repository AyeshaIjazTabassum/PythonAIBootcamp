# Assignment Week-1
**TASK 1: PYTHON BASICS & VARIABLES**
- Take user input for:
  - Name
  - Age
  - Favorite Programming Language
- Display the output using formatted strings (f-strings).
- Print the data type of each variable.

**TASK 2: CONTROL FLOW & LOGIC BUILDING**
- Ask the user to enter a number.
- Determine and display:
  - Whether the number is positive, negative, or zero.
  - Whether the number is even or odd.
- Handle invalid input using try-except blocks.

**TASK 3: LOOPS & PATTERN GENERATION**
- Print all prime numbers between 1 and 100.
- Use nested loops where applicable.

**TASK 4: FUNCTIONS & MODULAR PROGRAMMING**
- Build a function-based calculator that supports:
  - Addition
  - Subtraction
  - Multiplication
  - Division (handle division by zero)
- Implement a menu-driven interface.
- Each operation must be implemented as a separate function.

**TASK 5: INTRO TO AI THINKING WITH PYTHON**
- Create a dataset of students containing:
  - Student Name
  - Marks
- Calculate and display:
  - Average marks
  - Highest score
  - Lowest score
- Classify student performance using the following rules:
  - Marks 80 or above → Excellent
  - Marks between 60 and 79 → Good
  - Below 60 → Needs Improvement
 
**TASK 6: WEB SCRAPING WITH PYTHON**
- Use the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.
- Scrape data from a public website (such as quotes, headlines, job titles, or product names).
- Extract at least:
  - Title or heading
  - Description or related text
  - Store the scraped data in a Python list or dictionary.
- Display the extracted data in a clean and readable format.
- Bonus (Optional): Save the scraped data into a .txt or .csv file.
